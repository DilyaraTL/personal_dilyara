<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>Based on the life of Paul Gauguin, The Moon and Sixpence is W. Somerset Maugham's ode to the powerful forces behind creative genius.
<br>Charles Strickland is a staid banker, a man of wealth and privilege. He is also a man possessed of an unquenchable desire to create art. As Strickland pursues his artistic vision, he leaves London for Paris and Tahiti,</br>and in his quest makes sacrifices that leaves the lives of those closest to him in tatters.Through Maugham's sympathetic eye Strickland's tortured and cruel soul becomes a symbol of the blessing and the curse of transcendent artistic genius, and the cost in humans lives it sometimes demands.</p>

<h3>Full description:</h3>
<p>
  In the beginning, the story is about the brilliant artist Charles Strickland, who died in obscurity, and only an article by critic Maurice Gure saved him from oblivion. A flood of articles about
  <br>Strickland and his paintings poured, but at the same time the scandalous details of his life became clear. Further, the actual memories begin.
The storyteller‚Äôs first acquaintance with Strickland came at
  <br>a social gathering; he gave the impression of a kind and honest, but boring person. A few months later, the narrator found out that Strickland had abandoned his wife and children, having run away with some woman,
  <br> and was living with her in a luxurious expensive hotel. His wife asked the storyteller to meet with Strickland to convince him to return to the family. It turned out that the hotel was dirty and cheap, there was no woman,
  <br> and Strickland abandoned his family for painting. The fate of his wife and children is indifferent to him, and he will not return to them. He is also indifferent to financial position or fame. He paints because he "must write."</br>
  <br>Over the next five years, Strickland painted, living in poverty and interrupting casual earnings. The mediocre artist Dirk Struve, the only one at that time, discerned a genius in him and began to take care of Strickland, receiving only insults in return. When Strickland became seriously ill, Dirk transferred the patient to his home (despite the objections of his wife Blanche, who hated Strickland) and left.<br> Strickland repaid him by seducing the Struve Blanche, after which she declared that she would leave Dirk and go with Strickland anywhere. Having painted a nude portrait of Blanche Struve, he left her,
  <br> after which she committed suicide by drinking oxalic acid. Strickland showed no remorse or regret.
History is carried forward 15 years in advance. Strickland died long ago, and the Tahiti narrator is trying to restore
  <br> the last years of his life from the stories of people who knew him. It turns out that he led the life of a tramp, slept on the street or in shelters for the homeless, but continued to paint. Strickland spent the last years of his life
  <br> in Tahiti, where he married a native and died of leprosy. The masterpiece of his life - the painting on the walls of the house - was burned after death according to his will.</br>

<h3>History:</h3>
<p>
  The Moon and Sixpence (The Moon and Sixpence; literally "Moon and Sixpence") is a novel by the English writer William Somerset Maugham. The novel is a biography of the fictional character Charles Strickland,
  <br>an English stockbroker who, at the age of 40, suddenly abandons his wife and children to become an artist. The prototype of Charles Strickland was Paul Gauguin. The story is conducted in episodic
  <br>form on behalf of a young writer who allegedly ‚Äúsimply listed facts known to him from the life of an outstanding person.‚Äù The episodes from Strickland‚Äôs life are interspersed with the narrator‚Äôs thoughts about Strickland and other characters.

<h3>Criticism:</h3>
<p>
  Early Soviet criticism did not approve of the writer or his hero: for example, the literary encyclopedia in an article on Maugham in 1934 claimed that ‚Äúthe overproduction of the intelligentsia with all the consequences
  <br>that arose for it was reflected in one of M.S.‚Äôs best novels,‚Äú The Moon and penniless, whose characters - declassing intellectuals - raise a powerless rebellion against a society that has deprived them, a rebellion
  <br>expressed in the proclamation of the right to antisociality, in anarchist individualism, very far from understanding the true causes of the disastrous the provisions of the petty-bourgeois intelligentsia. Mogem Somerset
  <br>represents that group of petty-bourgeois intelligentsia that is incapable of fighting capitalism and is somehow reconciled with it. ‚Äù The same line was then followed by the critic Pyotr Palievsky, who wrote
  <br>about Maugham‚Äôs novel: ‚ÄúThe book was taken very seriously, although it did not stand out except for the hero‚Äôs insanity: neither he understands what is wrong with him, nor can we ask this if not we want to fall
  <br>into the category of dumbass."</br>
  <br>Later, in a more liberal atmosphere of the 1960s, the literary critic Maya Tugusheva noted: "Throughout the whole novel, there is a contrast between life entirely devoted to art and well-fed, vulgar, prudish well-being
  <br>of the philistines." Commenting on this interpretation, the critic Edward Kuzmin relies on the title of the book: "In the novel of Maugham on all two hundred pages, the moon is only mentioned once. The artist
  <br>is told that the law will force him to support his wife and children, will take them under protection. He replies:" And the law can remove moon from heaven? "" Grosh "<...> refers more to the little world of his wife,
  <br>from whom the artist escaped for the sake of painting <...> But the" moon "<...> is not just beautiful, but something inaccessible, unattainable, not subject to low ordinary laws. Inevitably attracting,
  <br>attracting, like the moon - lunatics. aromatic nearly three-quarters of the book nobody knows what happened to the former ordinary stockbroker. Everyone seems to be that he is possessed by a demon. "
